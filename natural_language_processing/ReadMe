Supervised NLP on movies reviews.
***************************************
*Reviews belong into two classes positive or negative. 

*Use and processing of texts from movies' reviews named "internal dataset" along with 
 pretrained world embeddings vocabulary, named "external".
 
*HDFS 

*Based on menu the user chooses if want to process the texts and store as HDFS the internal dataset only
or the internal and the external, such as to check the best option for the Neural Network.

*The Network has to learn to do the classification. 

*The configuration on datasets's processing and the model trainning 
  setted to be into one file using object serialization, when it was possible.  
  
 * Jenkins CI installed, connected to Github DeepLearning_job_,
   created job, set executors, scheduled jobs, build.
