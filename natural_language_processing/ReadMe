# Supervised NLP on movies reviews


* Reviews are as text and are either positive or negative
  Through text processing the NN will learn to do itself the binary
  supervised classification\

* Parameters for the  Data pipeline and the Model
  in one file using object serialization.

## Data Pipeline
_________________________________________________________________

* The processing of texts from the movies' reviews named
"internal dataset"
* Use of pretrained world embeddings vocabulary, named "external".
* Use of HDFS
* Precise logging

## Model
__________________________________________________________________

* Abraction OOP
* Read from the HDFS
* Trainning giving the choice of using of not the word embeddings
* Plot
* Precise logging

## DevOps
__________________________________________________________________

* Jenkins CI/CD installed and configured, connected to Github,
  with job named DeepLearning_job_,
* Jenkins Pipeline_job for the build and tests.
* Test Coverage

##Future Goals
________________________________________________________________
* Mock Tests
* MLFlow
