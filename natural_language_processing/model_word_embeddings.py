"""Not enough data available to learn truly
powerful features on your own, but you expect the features that you need to be fairly
genericâ€”that is. In this case, it makes
sense to reuse features learned on a different problem, so use pretrained Word Embedding
from GloVe or Word2Vec. If the data are a few if they are not the problem is not so generic and
pretrained embedding have worse result because of their generalization.
